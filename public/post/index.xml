      <description>Genki Sudo is a member of the upper house of Japan&amp;rsquo;s bicameral legislature. Western folks like myself might have unwittingly encountered him via these 2000s music videos of his music group World Order.
Before all this, Sudo was a professional mixed martial artist. He fought in several promotions, but in every arena he introduced himself idiosyncratically. Sudo choreographed WWE-like entrances that included:
 himself doing the robot with a KFC bucket hat, himself in Samurai garb, himself in &amp;ldquo;Neo-Samurai&amp;rdquo; garb  and ended every fight carrying the flag of his motto, &amp;ldquo;We Are All One&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s published! For several months in college I worked with Professor Hod Lipson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.creativemachineslab.com/&#34;&gt;Creative Machines Lab&lt;/a&gt; on building a &amp;ldquo;soft actuator&amp;rdquo;. The goal was to build an electrically-powered &amp;ldquo;muscle&amp;rdquo; geometry out of silicone; our approach was to drive contraction and expansion thermally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote 39,000+ words across 223 entries in my diary in the last 1.5 years. Could I learn more about my mood/emotions by analyzing my diary? I wrote some Python to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;T-shirt shooters often depend on compressed gases to rapidly eject rolled-up shirts. We wanted to experiment with a completely electric system, and make use of some of the raw materials and scrap electronics weâ€™d accumulated over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
