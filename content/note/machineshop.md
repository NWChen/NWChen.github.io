When I was in college, I spent a year on and off [building things with my hands for fun](http://neilchen.co/post/2017/01/01/building-a-t-shirt-shooting-robot/). The way I did that was generally by using the tools in one of two spaces:

1. the Mechanical Engineering department's `machine shop`, which contains all the _serious_ equipment: CNC mills, bandsaws, a big laser cutter
2. the campus `makerspace`, which contains all the _digital fabrication_ equipment: 3D printers, vinyl cutters, a small laser cutter

Both communities were special to me because they shared three features:

1. people building things
2. people seeing each other build things, and asking what they were building and why they were building it like that
3. people broadcasting feedback and advice on the things other people were building

The `machine shop` and the `makerspace` were both communities uniquely tailored to encouraging __friendcatching__ in the lowest-resistance way. (You can imagine the value of low-resistance socialization when the social group in question is a dozen engineering students, all of them with a slightly awkward social manner).
