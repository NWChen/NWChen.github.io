This is a collection of grappling (jiu-jitsu/wrestling/judo) content that seems consistently high signal-to-noise to me. 

- [Ayrshire Grappler](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNHEzJeEdSsf09A5uVPlXZw) - text-only commentary of famous jiu-jitsu matches, with east coast hip-hop classics in the background
- [The Grapple Club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2PoIQQmc0gOmzGiRKjJGQA/videos) - technique tutorials by prominent modern competitors
- [William Abreu](https://www.instagram.com/i_am_abreu/) - stand-up/takedown technique

Obviously _practicing more grappling_ is the best way to absorb this information, but during quarantine I'm enjoying these channels.
