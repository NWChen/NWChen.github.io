This is a collection of grappling (jiu-jitsu/wrestling/judo) content that seems consistently high signal-to-noise to me. I'm looking for a high ratio of `(footage/analysis of people grappling)` : `(footage of people talking)`:

- [The Grapple Club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2PoIQQmc0gOmzGiRKjJGQA/videos)
- [Ayrshire Grappler](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNHEzJeEdSsf09A5uVPlXZw)
- [William Abreu](https://www.instagram.com/i_am_abreu/) 

Obviously _practicing more grappling_ is the best way to absorb this information, but during quarantine I'm enjoying these channels.
