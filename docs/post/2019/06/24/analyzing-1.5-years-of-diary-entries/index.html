<main>
<p>I wrote 39,000+ words across 223 entries in my diary in the last 1.5 years. Could I learn more about my mood/emotions by analyzing my diary? I wrote some Python to find out.</p>
<p><a href="#results">(skip to results)</a></p>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>
<p>Diary entries are usually emotive and abstract. Below I describe an approach to quantifying my mood over the last 1.5 years. This dataset consists of diary entries written either when I was attending college or working full-time. All of my diary entries share the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time of last update (for example: <code>January 10th, 2018, at 7:20pm</code>)</li>
<li>Name of entry (for example: <code>happy-to-see-you.txt</code>)</li>
<li>Text content (the actual entry)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sentiment-analysis">Sentiment analysis</h2>
<p>I quantify the content of each diary entry by its <strong>sentiment</strong>: how positive or negative I felt in each entry. <strong>Sentiment analysis</strong> is an approach to automatically identifying opinions/feelings in a text. My pipeline has 3 steps, all using some subset of <code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code>, and <code>matplotlib</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data cleanup.</strong> I filter out <em>stop words</em>. In natural language processing, <em>stop words</em> are tokens like <code>a</code>, <code>of</code>, <code>the</code>. These common words are syntactically important for language, but they carry little information and aren&rsquo;t useful for sentiment analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Lookup sentiment in the Emotion Lexicon.</strong> The <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon</a> maps an index of 14,000+ words to eight basic emotions: anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust. I simply look up a word in the Emotion Lexicon and retrieve its associated emotion, for all 39,000 words in my diary.</li>
<li><strong>Classify sentiment with <code>word2vec</code>.</strong> Many words in my diary aren&rsquo;t catalogued in the Emotion Lexicon, so I trained a classifier using <code>word2vec</code> and <code>sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression</code> to identify the sentiment of almost all the remaining words.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Like most people, I usually write about myself or other people. Since we filtered out <em>stop words</em>, common but relatively meaningless tokens like <code>on</code>, <code>for</code>, etc. are omitted. Below are the top 20 words which occur most frequently in my diary, dominantly concerning topics like <code>thinking</code> and <code>people</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/diary/overview_1.png" alt="overview1"></p>
<p>Most of my diary entries are under 200 words. The most significant outlier, at 3,278 words, is about distractions and a short attention span. At bottom left, I bin diary entries based on word count. At bottom right, the horizontal axis is the time domain, and each point represents 1 of my 223 diary entires (with the 3,278-word outlier on Nov 2018).</p>
<p><img src="/img/diary/overview_2.png" alt="overview2"></p>
<h3 id="weekly-trends">Weekly trends</h3>
<p>I write the most on the weekends. As the week progresses, I spend more time studying/working, and consequentially less time writing. On Saturdays, I apparently unload all that&rsquo;s accumulated during the week.</p>
<p><img src="/img/diary/weekly_trends_1.png" alt="weekly1"></p>
<p>Compared to the mean, on Thursdays (my most negative day) I&rsquo;m more negative by a delta of 4.7%. Sorry to everyone I hung out with on Thursdays. As expected, positive and negative sentiment are inversely related and tend to settle at a more positive mood during the weekend.</p>
<p><img src="/img/diary/weekly_trends_2.png" alt="weekly2"></p>
<p>The <strong>NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon</strong> lets us look at other emotions too. As shown below, throughout the week I consistently anticipate the arrival of the weekend. Similarly, sadness achieves a maximum in the middle of the business week, then steadily declines as we approach the weekend. That seems consistent with reality:</p>
<p><img src="/img/diary/weekly_trends_3.png" alt="weekly3"></p>
<h3 id="long-run-trends">Long-run trends</h3>
<p>As approximate metrics of mood, the intensity of positive and negative sentiment are both normally distributed. Negative sentiment has a slightly left-skewed distribution, with a long-tail on the left. Sentiment is normalized to the length of each diary entry.</p>
<p><img src="/img/diary/long_run_2.png" alt="longrun1"></p>
<p>Below I show the total sentiment (<code>positive sentiment - negative sentiment</code>) expressed in my diary. This provides a rough metric of positive (<code>sentiment&gt;0</code>) or negative (<code>sentiment&lt;0</code>) mood. Total sentiment takes a value between -1.0 and +1.0. Over 1.5 years my mood (as measured by positive/negative sentiment) has steadily tended towards more positive sentiment. I take the rolling mean of each sentiment score over a 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month window:</p>
<p><img src="/img/diary/long_run_1.png" alt="longrun2"></p>
<p>Mood in the past 1.5 years as measured by total sentiment is fairly volatile, with standard deviation <code>0.298</code> for sentiment in the range <code>-1.0</code> to <code>1.0</code>. <code>95%</code> of diary entries have a total sentiment score that lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean sentiment (consistent with the normality of the distribution of positive and negative sentiment).</p>
<p>If my mood (as measured by sentiment) reverts to the mean, then even when sentiment drifts towards the positive or negative extreme I can expect it to settle back towards the mean. Knowing whether mood is mean-reverting might allow me to reduce the stress I experience during periods of negative mood. We can test whether mood is reverts to the mean in the long run with a quick stationarity test. Using the augmented Dickey-Fuller test (<code>statsmodels.tsa.adfuller</code>), we find that total sentiment is mean-reverting (<code>p&lt;0.05</code>).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Based on my diary, my mood as measured by total sentiment is mean-reverting and most positive during the weekends but otherwise fairly volatile. None of this analysis offers a concrete statement about my mood, though, since the approach is crude and my approach fails to capture some relevant information.</p>
<p>In summary I didn&rsquo;t learn much from this, and I&rsquo;ve got a lot of statistics to review. But the graphs are pretty, right?</p>
