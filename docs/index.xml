      <description>This is a running list of some of my favorite accounts of personal rejection or failure (narrowly: in school and in tech).
 Ian Goodfellow Ian Goodfellow&amp;rsquo;s name is now roughly synonymous with &amp;ldquo;deep learning&amp;rdquo;, but he describes plenty of personal risks, subsequent failures, and post-facto views on them:
 I once applied for a summer internship with a Stanford professor. My transcript was included in my application. He replied â€œWhy do you have an A in my class?</description>

      <title>vim-repl workflow</title>

      <description>One of the tools I wish I&amp;rsquo;d known about sooner is vim-repl. It&amp;rsquo;s a vim plugin that opens an interactive REPL, configurable based on source file type (.py, .hs, .scala, &amp;hellip;)
 A REPL, or read-eval-print-loop, lets you input, evaluate, and output expressions without having to (for example) compile an entire program.
 I used to run this workflow using SLIME and tmux. Before that, if I wanted a development environment with a tight feedback loop between writing &amp;amp; evaluating code, I defaulted to a Jupyter notebook &amp;ndash; which, for this purpose, is probably both the wrong tool to use and often (for me) unsustainable.</description>

      <description>If you, with no prior training, picked up a 1/2&amp;quot; chisel, a handsaw, a rubber mallet, and a Home Depot bench plane, you&amp;rsquo;d arrive at a reasonable approximation of my 2020.
Workbench This is a hastily-made workbench/work-from-home standing desk. The legs are 3.5&amp;quot; douglas fir and joined via mortise-and-tenon. The top surface is 1.5&amp;quot; thick fir. Half-finished:

To handle racking, there are three chunky sections of pine joined by cross laps to the legs of the bench.</description>

      <description>Genki Sudo is a member of the upper house of Japan&amp;rsquo;s bicameral legislature. Western folks like myself might have unwittingly encountered him via these 2000s music videos of his music group World Order.
Before all this, Sudo was a professional mixed martial artist. He fought in several promotions, but in every arena he introduced himself idiosyncratically. Sudo choreographed WWE-like entrances that included:
 himself doing the robot with a KFC bucket hat, himself as a baseball player, himself in Samurai garb,  and ended every fight carrying the flag of his motto, &amp;ldquo;We Are All One&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s published! For several months in college I worked with Professor Hod Lipson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.creativemachineslab.com/&#34;&gt;Creative Machines Lab&lt;/a&gt; on building a &amp;ldquo;soft actuator&amp;rdquo;. The goal was to build an electrically-powered &amp;ldquo;muscle&amp;rdquo; geometry out of silicone; our approach was to drive contraction and expansion thermally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote 39,000+ words across 223 entries in my diary in the last 1.5 years. Could I learn more about my mood/emotions by analyzing my diary? I wrote some Python to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have an amateur and casual interest in robotics, from mechanical design to grasping and manipulation. In my first year of college, I played with the idea of building a 100lb. t-shirt shooting robot to drive around &amp;amp; eject shirts into crowds. We were very fortunate to get a bit of money from a student group on campus, access to the Columbia University MakerSpace, and a few dumpsters with nice DC motors and aluminum extrusion sitting around.</description>
