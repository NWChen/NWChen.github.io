<p>If you, with no prior training, picked up a 1/2&quot; chisel, a handsaw, a rubber mallet, and a Home Depot bench plane, you&rsquo;d arrive at a reasonable approximation of my 2020.</p>
<h2 id="workbench">Workbench</h2>
<p>This is a hastily-made workbench/work-from-home standing desk. The legs are 3.5&quot; douglas fir and joined via mortise-and-tenon. The top surface is 1.5&quot; thick fir. Half-finished:</p>
<p><a href=""><img src="/img/wood/1.jpg" style="width:320px;height:280px;"></a></p>
<p>To handle racking, there are three chunky sections of pine joined by cross laps to the legs of the bench.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this bench as the work surface for all my other projects. It&rsquo;s also my daily work-from-home desk:</p>
<p><a href=""><img src="/img/wood/3.jpg" style="width:320px;height:400px;"></a></p>
<h2 id="shoe-rack">Shoe rack</h2>
<p>I live with 3 other people and the shoe storage situation was becoming overcrowded. The fir scraps from the workbench make up the legs of this shoe rack. Everything else comes from scrap wood off the street.</p>
<p><a href=""><img src="/img/wood/4.jpg" style="width:320px;height:240px;"></a></p>
<h2 id="tv-stand">TV stand</h2>
<p>My roommate was about to throw away his desk. It&rsquo;s one of those desks you buy off the internet &ndash; the legs are made of thin-walled aluminum, and the surface is OSB with veneer glued on. Thankfully he gave it to me before it went to the dumpster.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do any reliable joinery with OSB (it just falls apart), so I made one long rip cut along the length of the OSB. That surface makes for a nice shelf, e.g. for holding a Baby Yoda:</p>
