<p>When I was in college, I spent a year on and off <a href="http://neilchen.co/post/2017/01/01/building-a-t-shirt-shooting-robot/">building things with my hands for fun</a>. The way I did that was generally by using the tools in one of two spaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Mechanical Engineering department&rsquo;s <code>machine shop</code>, which contains all the <em>serious</em> equipment: CNC mills, bandsaws, a big laser cutter</li>
<li>the campus <code>makerspace</code>, which contains all the <em>digital fabrication</em> equipment: 3D printers, vinyl cutters, a small laser cutter</li>
</ol>
<p>Both communities were special to me because they shared three features:</p>
<ol>
<li>people building things</li>
<li>people seeing each other build things, and asking what they were building and why they were building it like that</li>
<li>people broadcasting feedback and advice on the things other people were building</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>machine shop</code> and the <code>makerspace</code> were both communities uniquely tailored to encouraging <strong>friendcatching</strong> in the lowest-resistance way. (You can imagine the value of low-resistance socialization when the social group in question is a dozen engineering students, all of them with a slightly awkward social manner).</p>
