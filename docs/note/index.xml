      <description>When I was in college, I spent a year on and off building things with my hands for fun. The way I did that was generally by misappropriating study time and instead spending it in the machine shop. It&amp;rsquo;s a place where:
 people build different things people see each other build different things, and ask what they&amp;rsquo;re working on &amp;amp; why they&amp;rsquo;re working on it people broadcast feedback and advice on the things other people were building  The machine shop was a community uniquely tailored to encouraging friendcatching in the lowest-resistance way.</description>

      <description>This is a collection of grappling (jiu-jitsu/wrestling/judo) content that seems consistently high signal-to-noise to me.
  Ayrshire Grappler - text-only commentary of famous jiu-jitsu matches, with east coast hip-hop classics in the background 
  The Grapple Club - technique tutorials by prominent modern competitors 
  William Abreu - stand-up/takedown technique 
  Obviously practicing more grappling is the best way to absorb this information, but during quarantine I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying these channels.</description>

      <description>If you, with no prior training, picked up a 1/2&amp;quot; chisel, a handsaw, a rubber mallet, and a Home Depot bench plane, you&amp;rsquo;d arrive at a reasonable approximation of my 2020.
Workbench This is a hastily-made workbench/work-from-home standing desk. The legs are 3.5&amp;quot; douglas fir and joined via mortise-and-tenon. The top surface is 1.5&amp;quot; thick fir. Half-finished:

To handle racking, there are three chunky sections of pine joined by cross laps to the legs of the bench.</description>

      <description>Genki Sudo is a member of the upper house of Japan&amp;rsquo;s bicameral legislature. Western folks like myself might have unwittingly encountered him via these 2000s music videos of his music group World Order.
Before all this, Sudo was a professional mixed martial artist. He fought in several promotions, but in every arena he introduced himself idiosyncratically. Sudo choreographed WWE-like entrances that included:
 himself doing the robot with a KFC bucket hat, himself as a baseball player, himself in Samurai garb,  and ended every fight carrying the flag of his motto, &amp;ldquo;We Are All One&amp;rdquo;:</description>
