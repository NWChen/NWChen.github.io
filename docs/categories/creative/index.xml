      <description>When I was in college, I spent a year on and off building things with my hands for fun. The way I did that was generally by using the tools in one of two spaces:
 the Mechanical Engineering department&amp;rsquo;s machine shop, which contains all the serious equipment: CNC mills, bandsaws, a big laser cutter the campus makerspace, which contains all the digital fabrication equipment: 3D printers, vinyl cutters, a small laser cutter  Both communities were special to me because they shared three features:</description>

      <description>If you, with no prior training, picked up a 1/2&amp;quot; chisel, a handsaw, a rubber mallet, and a Home Depot bench plane, you&amp;rsquo;d arrive at a reasonable approximation of my 2020.
Workbench This is a hastily-made workbench/work-from-home standing desk. The legs are 3.5&amp;quot; douglas fir and joined via mortise-and-tenon. The top surface is 1.5&amp;quot; thick fir. Half-finished:

To handle racking, there are three chunky sections of pine joined by cross laps to the legs of the bench.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote 39,000+ words across 223 entries in my diary in the last 1.5 years. Could I learn more about my mood/emotions by analyzing my diary? I wrote some Python to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have an amateur and casual interest in robotics, from mechanical design to grasping and manipulation. In my first year of college, I played with the idea of building a 100lb. t-shirt shooting robot to drive around &amp;amp; eject shirts into crowds. We were very fortunate to get a bit of money from a student group on campus, access to the Columbia University MakerSpace, and a few dumpsters with nice DC motors and aluminum extrusion sitting around.</description>
