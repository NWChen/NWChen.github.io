      <description>If you, with no prior training, picked up a 1/2&amp;quot; chisel, a handsaw, a rubber mallet, and a Home Depot bench plane, you&amp;rsquo;d arrive at a reasonable approximation of my 2020.
Workbench This is a hastily-made workbench/work-from-home standing desk. The legs are 3.5&amp;quot; douglas fir and joined via mortise-and-tenon. The top surface is 1.5&amp;quot; thick fir. Half-finished:

To handle racking, there are three chunky sections of pine joined by cross laps to the legs of the bench.</description>

      <description>I have an amateur and casual interest in robotics, from mechanical design to grasping and manipulation. In my first year of college, I played with the idea of building a 100lb. t-shirt shooting robot to drive around &amp;amp; eject shirts into crowds.
